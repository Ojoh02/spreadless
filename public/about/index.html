        <h1 class='cough'>Experimentation Details</h1>
        <p class='cough'>
          After becoming intrigued by why we stand 6 feet
          apart, I began gathering resources together that
          would help myself and others understand our cough
          and breath better. A study conducted by Florida
          Atlantic University was able to use a laser
          light sheet and a cough simulator to visualize the
          cough and how a face mask affected it. Using this
          as inspiriation, I created my own laser light
          sheet and obtained my own fog machine for
          experimentation. Instead of a mannequin coughing,
          however, it would be me. Taking all the necessary
          safety precautions, a setup was created where
          I would cough into a concentrated fog box
          that would then eject a cough in the form of fog.
          The fog was created using a 3:1 water to glycerin
          mixture, and the laser light sheet was obtained
          by using a 532nm green laser and a borosilicate
          glass rod. The cough was recorded by taking a long
          exposure image of the cough from above. The entire
          cough could be seen by using a tripod to put the
          camera at a high enough point above the vapor.
          The distance the cough traveled was measured in
          feet using markers on the ground. The microphone
          recording the cough was a constant 1.5 feet away
          from me as to give accurate cough data. Each
          cough sound FFT was matched with a certain size
          cough (in terms of density and distance traveled).
          Over 100 coughs were done and inputed into the
          database. The algorithmic part of the project
          that led to the prediction is explained in
          detail in "The Process" description. A picture
          of the experimentation is provided below.

          <img src='../img/about.png' class='cough aboutPicture col-lg-5'>

          <h1 class='cough'>The Process</h1>
          <p class='cough'>
          Initially, the audio input is converted into a
          visualization of a Fast Fourier transform (FFT)
          that a convolutional neural network (CNN) can then
          use to identify key components of the cough. Once
          the CNN makes a prediction on a strength (classified
          between 0 and 9), a multivariable linear regression
          algorithm predicts the image of the cough. This prediction
          is based on over a hundred cough images processed into a
          pixel array with thousands of individual comparisons. In
          total, the predicted image is created by a machine learning
          model that has gone through over a million total
          comparisons. Once the prediction is complete, each individual
          pixel's HSB color value is used to identify key
          components of the cough. Values below a certain threshold
          are cut out to distinguish the cough from the rest of
          the image, and border pixels were used to calculate the
          cough's breadth and length. The higher the pixel value,
          the more dense and larger the particles in that pixel
          are, which is used to calculate the regions within a cough
          that are more likely to transmit the virus and/or bacteria.</p>

          <h1 class='cough'>The Accuracy</h1>
          <p class='cough'>
          The correlation with the chance of getting the virus is based
          off of a study by the medical journal The Lancet. The Lancet
          is known as one of the world's oldest, best-known, and comprehensive
          peer-reviewed general medical journals. They state
          "The primary limitation of our study is that
          all studies were non-randomised, not always fully adjusted, and might
          suffer from recall and measurement bias (eg, direct contact in some
          studies might not be measuring near distance). However, unadjusted,
          adjusted, frequentist, and Bayesian meta-analyses all supported the main findings,
          and large or very large effects were recorded. Nevertheless, we are cautious
          not to be overly certain in the precise quantitative estimates of effects,
          although the qualitative effect and direction is probably of high certainty."
          Thus, while the data is not perfect by any means, it provides a
          good baseline to estimate the chance of getting the virus. From their
          findings, they estimate that within 1 meter in distance between two
          people, there is around a 13% risk of being infected. This risk decreases
          greatly at 2 meters and 3 meters away, being in the low single digits.
          The Lancet provides a useful graph illustrating their findings. My
          algorithm takes their risk findings and relates it with particle density,
          with particles about a certain threshold having a specified infection
          rate. Using the pixel values to evaluate the density, I was able to
          create an algorithm that matches closely with the research from The Lancet.
          The algorithm was created so that it recognizes that a person has around a
          13% infection rate at 1 meter away, and a drastic reduction as the distance
          increases. I found remarkable similarities between the graphs provided
          by The Lancet and mine, affirming the idea that density is an adequate
          method of finding the infection rate of the virus at various distances. </p>

            The correlation with the chance of getting the virus and exposure
            time is based off a study by the University of the Philippines
            College of Medicine. Their study measured the time people were exposed
            to the virus and compared it to the number of newly infected people.
            The data used in my calculations was based on the exposure of
            talking to just one person, but the study also includes an 'encounter'
            value that could factor in the exposure of more than one person. The
            percent chance of being infected was based off of the fraction of one
            new infection in the graphs provided within the study.

          <h1 class='cough'>The Significance</h1>
          <p class='cough'>
            Awareness. We need to be aware of our actions
            and how they can affect other people. While there
            are countless studies and simulations published by
            major news sources and large research journals,
            none can directly impact on an individual level.
            We may not think we play a large role in the
            spread of the virus and we may not want to take
            social distancing rules seriously, but I hope
            this site can show its importance and answer
            the question: Why do we stand 6 feet apart?</p>

            <p class='cough'>
              All of the code began from scratch. The website
              was created using tools from Bootstrap and JQuery without the
              usage of pre-made templates. Javscript, CSS, and HTML
              were used to construct the website. The machine
              learning was coded using Tensorflow.js without the
              use of pre-existing models. All of the over one thousand
              models were created from my algorithm. I learned
              the optimal machine learning algorithm by testing
              MNIST data. p5.js was used for the Fast Fourier transform
              canvas. Node.js was used for server-side programming,
              alongside Express.js. The NeDB node package manager was
              used to create a database to hold all the cough data.
              Lastly, Chart.js was used to create the charts shown
              throughout the site.

              The Fluid Simulator utilized much of the code from Pavel Dobryakov's
              fluid simulation, but was optimized to match with the approximate

        <p class='cough'>These 4 graphs illustrate the trends
          identified in the cough algorithm. "Cough strength"
          is measured by the size and shape of your audio input.
          The chance of getting the virus was found by comparing
          data from scientific studies with the different components
          of the cough. The chance measured is within the first five
          minutes, which is relatively short exposure.</p>
